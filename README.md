This is a project built mainly to get experience building an iOS app programmatically. I chose to build this from a tutorial, by Sean Allen, because building iOS apps
programmitcally is important. There are several reason why I chose to learn programmatic UI.
- Programmatic is source control friendly
- Allows builder to create reusable components

Features:
- Search for a Github user
- View Gituhb user's followers
- View Github profile details
- Add Github user to favorites

Techonology Used:
- Swift, UIKit - Build app programmatically
- Github API - Fetch github user information

### Things I learned:
- How to implement search functionality programmatically
- How to make reusable views and components with UIKit programmatically
  Makes code easier to read and avoiding the need to repeat code
- How to organize code and archeticture
- How to create network calls
- How to implement UICollectionView programmatically
- ARC, Memory Leaks and Capture Lists
- Pagination
- How to implement a loading view
