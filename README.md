This is a project built mainly to get experience building an iOS app programmatically. I chose to build this from a tutorial, by Sean Allen, because building iOS apps
programmitcally is important. There are several reason why I chose to learn programmatic UI.
- Programmatic is source control friendly
- Allows builder to create reusable components

Features:
- Search for a Github user
- Search Github user's followers
- View Gituhb user's followers
- View Github profile details
- View Github profile in SafariViewController
- Add Github user to favorites
